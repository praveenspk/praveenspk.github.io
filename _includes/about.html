    <h2>A void to fill</h2>
    
    <p> This is my portfolio page. I have used various platforms to collaborate with coworkers, including Git, but also others. As a Software development professional, my Github profile is not the best representation of my work as a whole. I think a lot of developers feel that way, especially if they work in the private sector and are not heavily contributing to Open Source. (Software Engineers shouldn't necessarily be measured by their Github profiles!)</p>

    <p>Thus, enter the portfolio site! I decided to make this site to show others what I have really been working on and to catalog my achievements!</p>
